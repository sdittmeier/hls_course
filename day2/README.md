## 📜 Component Details

### 🔧 [`pointers/`](./pointers)
This folder contains examples demonstrating pointer manipulation in Vitis HLS, including basic arithmetic and memory allocation.

### 🔧 [`streams/`](./streams)
This folder contains examples demonstrating stream usage in Vitis HLS.

### 🔧 [`matmul/`](./matmul)
This folder contains the example project for matrix multiplication using Vitis HLS.

Each component builds on the previous and is designed to be clear and reproducible.

📁 See the respective folders for the actual HLS source files.
